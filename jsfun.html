        <h1>The Fundamentals of JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Feb 8 2025</p>
        <p>Recognizing the importance of understanding Javascript for browser exploitation, I've started with the basics. One has to learn to crawl before they can walk. I'm beginning my journey by getting a bit of context about JavaScript and when, where, and what it's used for.</p>
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting/programming language that can be used for the manipulation of the behavior of web pages. It's often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build web pages. Using JavaScript, one can implement complex and dynamic features (updates to content, animated graphics, etc.) so that web pages aren't as static.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used primarily in the browser, and enables developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, retrieve content from servers using the fetch() API, store complex data, draw graphics, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, etc.</p>
        <p>JavaScript can be used for both client-side scripts on webpages and also server-side applications.</p>
        <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>Using JavaScript allows you to store values inside variables. For example, when prompting a visitor for a username for a game, the entered username is stored inside the appropriate variable. You can begin to understand how useful this is for creating engaging pages.</p>
        <p>It also allows for operations on strings (pieces of text). For example, using JavaScript we can concatenate a string to a defined variable.</p>
        <p>Equally as important, JavaScript can run code in response to events occuring on a web page. A good example is the `click` event element in JavaScript, in which an element receives a `click` event based on certain conditions. If the user performs a touch gesture, or presses and releases the mouse while the pointer is located inside the element, or presses the Space or Enter keys while the element is focused, said element will receive the `click` event.</p>
        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>What's an element? An element is a part of a web page. Elements are part of the DOM.</p>
        <p>More clearly, elements are individual components or parts of a web page (like a paragraph, image, or button), and they are represented within the Document Object Model (DOM)</p>
        <p>Naturally, you're wondering what the DOM is.</p>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>In a very basic definition, the DOM is a hierarchical structure that represents the HTML document as a tree of objects, where each element is a node.</p>
        <p>DOM stands for (Document Object Model), and it's an API that interacts with HTML or XML-based documents. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and dynamically manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages. More specifically, it allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, create and change and remove HTML, dynamically apply styles to your web page, and more. When new content is displayed or a popup appears, it's often through the DOM being updated in response to user interaction or JavaScript code.</p>
        <p>The DOM is loaded in the browser and represents the document it's interacting with as a node tree (also called DOM tree), in which each node represents a part of the document. For example, an element, text string, or comment are all examples of nodes.</p>
        <p>The DOM is a very common API used on the Web because it allows for code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in a given document. With the DOM, nodes can be created, changed, and moved.</p>
        <p>On the occurence of a given event, event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered. For example, a button element can be created in HTML, then in the JavaScript, the addEventListener() method can be used on the button element to attach a `click` event listener to the button. Finally, when the button is clicked by the user, the function inside the event listener is triggered, which could update the text contents of a paragraph to display a different message.</p>
        <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>In more detail, an event listener is a function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur and then responds to it. The event listener function allows you to create custom responses to events such as mouse clicks, keyboard clicks, and window resizing. This relates to event handling, which is the concept of waiting and responding to real-time events.</p>
        <p>Event listeners in JavaScript can change displayed text, collect information from forms, or store data in databases based on certain preconditions.</p>
        <p>In event listener functions, you program the function to perform specific actions when the event occurs, but you first have to add it to the respective JavaScript element, using certain syntax such as:
</p>
        <p>element.addEventListener(event, listener);</p>
        <p>element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture);</p>
        <p>element.addEventListener(event, listener, options);</p>
