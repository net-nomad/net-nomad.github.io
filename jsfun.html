        <h1>The Fundamentals of JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Feb 8 2025</p>
        <p>Recognizing the importance of understanding Javascript for browser exploitation, I've started with the basics. One has to learn to crawl before they can walk. I'm beginning my journey by getting a bit of context about JavaScript and when, where, and what it's used for.</p>
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting/programming language that can be used for the manipulation of the behavior of web pages. It's often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build web pages. Using JavaScript, one can implement complex and dynamic features (updates to content, animated graphics, etc.) so that web pages aren't as static.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used primarily in the browser, and enables developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, retrieve content from servers using the fetch() API, store complex data, draw graphics, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, etc.</p>
        <p>JavaScript can be used for both client-side scripts on webpages and also server-side applications.</p>
        <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>Using JavaScript allows you to store values inside variables. For example, when prompting a visitor for a username for a game, the entered username is stored inside the appropriate variable. You can begin to understand how useful this is for creating engaging pages.</p>
        <p>It also allows for operations on strings (pieces of text). For example, using JavaScript we can concatenate a string to a defined variable.</p>
        <p>Equally as important, JavaScript can run code in response to events occuring on a web page. A good example is the `click` event element in JavaScript, in which an element receives a `click` event based on certain conditions. If the user performs a touch gesture, or presses and releases the mouse while the pointer is located inside the element, or presses the Space or Enter keys while the element is focused, said element will receive the `click` event.</p>
        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>What's an element? An element is a part of a web page. Elements are part of the DOM.</p>
        <p>More clearly, elements are individual components or parts of a web page (like a paragraph, image, or button), and they are represented within the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
        <p>Naturally, you're wondering what the DOM is.</p>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>In a very basic definition, the DOM is a hierarchical structure that represents the HTML document as a tree of objects, where each element is a node.</p>
        <p>DOM stands for (Document Object Model), and it's an API that interacts with HTML or XML-based documents. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and dynamically manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages. More specifically, it allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, create and change and remove HTML, dynamically apply styles to your web page, and more. When new content is displayed or a popup appears, it's often through the DOM being updated in response to user interaction or JavaScript code.</p>
        <p>The DOM is loaded in the browser and represents the document it's interacting with as a node tree (also called DOM tree), in which each node represents a part of the document. For example, an element, text string, or comment are all examples of nodes.</p>
        <p>The DOM is a very common API used on the Web because it allows for code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in a given document. With the DOM, nodes can be created, changed, and moved. You can manipulate nodes (elements, text, attributes, etc.) through JavaScript by using various methods and properties.</p>
        <p>On the occurence of a given event, event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered. For example, a button element can be created in HTML, then in the JavaScript, the addEventListener() method can be used on the button element to attach a `click` event listener to the button. Finally, when the button is clicked by the user, the function inside the event listener is triggered, which could update the text contents of a paragraph to display a different message.</p>
        <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>Event listeners in JavaScript can change displayed text, collect information from forms, or store data in databases based on certain preconditions. For example, after collecting information, an event listener can trigger an API call to store that data in a database.</p>
        <p>In more detail, an event listener is a function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur and then responds to it. The event listener function allows you to create custom responses to events such as mouse clicks, keyboard clicks, and window resizing. This relates to event handling, which is the concept of waiting and responding to real-time events.</p>
        <p>Event listeners in JavaScript can change displayed text, collect information from forms, or store data in databases based on certain preconditions.</p>
        <p>In event listener functions, you define the function to perform specific actions when an event occurs, but you first have to attach it to the respective JavaScript element using methods like `addEventListener()`.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
function handleClick() {
    console.log("Element clicked!");
}
            
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
        </code></pre>  
        <p>Here, the `handleClick` function is triggered whenever the "click" event happens on the element with the ID `myButton`, thanks to `addEventListener()`.</p>
        <p>We first define the function named `handleClick`. This function contains the action you want to perform when the event occurs. In this case, when the "click" event happens, "Element clicked!" will be printed to the console.</p>
        <p>We then use the `addEventListener` method to attach the `handleClick` function to an element (such as a button or a div), so that when the user clicks on the specified element, the `handleClick` function will run, and will consequently print the message to the console, as mentioned before.</p>
        <h3>Functions in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, functions act as building blocks, or like procedures—functions consist of a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. However, for a function to be considered a function, it usually takes some input and return an output, and there is typically some kind of relationship between the input and output.</p>
        <p>More generally, a function is like a "subprogram" that can be called by code external, or internal to the function. A function is made of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function as parameters, and as a result, the function will often return a value.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  let sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
            
let result = addNumbers(3, 5);
            
console.log(result);
        </code></pre> 
        <p>Here we have a function in JavaScript, with the first line, we are defining the function. `addNumbers` is the name of the function, and `a` and `b` are the function parameters of `addNumbers`. `a` and `b` represent the input values for the function that'll be used in the calculations or operations within the function body.</p>
        <p>On the next line is the function body. The function body contains two statements to add and then return the results of the addition of `a` and `b`.</p>
        <p>After defining the function, we call the function using `addNumbers(3, 5)` and store the result of the addition in the variable `result`. And so, the function returns the sum of the two numbers we supplied to the function.</p>
        <p>`console.log(result);` is used to output or display the value of `result` to the console. Specifically, `console` is an object in JavaScript that provides methods to interact with the browser's developer tool console. `log` is a method of the object `console`, and is used to output whatever is passed to it as an argument.</p>
        <p>In our case, `result` is the variable holding the value that is returned from the `addNumbers(3, 5)` function, which is 8. As a result, calling `console.log(result);` will print 8 to the console, allowing you to see the result of the function call.</p>
        <h3>Objects in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are used to store and access data. Consider the following:</p>
        <pre><code>
const person = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 30,
  gender: 'male'
};
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the example above, `name`, `age`, and `gender` are the keys, and "Bob", `30`, and "male" are the values. Keys (also called "properties") are simply the property names of an object. They represent the "labels" or "names" for the values stored inside the object. In our case, "Bob", `30`, and "male" are the values stored in the keys `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We can access the values of the keys of this object by using, for example, `console.log(person.name);`, which would of course output "Bob".</p>
        <p>An array containing all keys of an object can be obtained using `Object.keys()`. `Object.keys()` is a JavaScript method that will return an array of an object's own enumerable property names (in this case, the keys of the object `person`). The syntax to do so is as follows: Object.keys(obj) where `obj` in `(obj)` is substituted with the name of the object whose keys we want to retrieve.</p>
        <p>While both objects and arrays store data, objects use keys (keys can be strings, numbers, or symbols) to store and access data, whereas arrays use numeric indices (starting from 0) to store and access elements.
</p>
        <p>Values—which are mapped to keys—can be any data type, including objects.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated, objects in JavaScript are used to store data in a structured way. They can also be used to create reusable code and they can also be used to create complex data structures.
</p>
        <p>The purpose of the key-value structure is so that data contained in an object can be organized in a flexible and readable way. Objects in JavaScript can store other objects or arrays as values, adding to their effectiveness as tools for managing data. Consider the following:
</p>
        <pre><code>
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown"
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "sports"]
};
        </code></pre>
        <p>Here, the `address` key (property) is an object, and the `hobbies` key (property) is an array. Both are stored as values within the `person` object. This is an example of an object storing an object in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>We declare objects using curly braces `{ }`, and the key-value pairs are separated by commas. Keys are always followed by a colon, and values can be followed by a comma.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of an object in JavaScript, where `species`, `breed`, and `age` are keys (properties), and "dog", "Labrador", and "5" are the corresponding values for each key.</p>
        <pre><code>
const animal = {
  species: 'dog',
  breed: 'Labrador',
  age: 5
};
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
